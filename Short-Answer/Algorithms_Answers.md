#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
Linear O(n), the input is looping at n^3 times

b)
O(n log n), i.e. O(n^2) - j is multiplied by 2 each time

c)
Recursive 0(n) loop

## Exercise II

Drop eggs from every floor until the first floor when the egg breaks.
When the egg breaks we know that the egg doesn't break in the floors below.
The first floor the egg breaks on is called floor f.
This is O(n) runtime complexity - it loops through every floor until a match, in this case floor f, is found.
